# BYOND extools
External tools for BYOND. Used to fiddle with the game engine's internals.

## Isn't there a project just like this already?
Most of development of [Lunar-Dreamland](https://github.com/goonstation/Lunar-Dreamland) has shifted from Lua to C++. I got tired of having to interface between them, so I decided to go with the latter.

## What can I do with it?
Here are the modules currently available (not counting the core). Scroll to the bottom to see install instructions.

#### Proc hooking
Not exactly a module, but still useful. Hooking allows you to reimplement procs in C++, which usually run much faster, especially if the hooked proc is, for example, just math operations.

#### TFFI
Threaded FFI for BYOND. Automagically threads off all DLL calls and prevents them from locking up the game until they return. You may use a Promise datum, pass a callback (global or an object) or simply sleep until the call returns.

#### Optimizer
Currently a proof of concept. The only optimization available is inlining - the optimizer will go through all procs and attempt to inline global proc calls to eliminate call overhead. At the time of writing optimizing takes an incredibly long time to finish, which makes it infeasible to use.

#### Maptick
Hooks an internal BYOND function which sends map updates to players, and measures time taken to execute it. The result is written to a global variable called `internal_tick_usage`. SS13 servers can use this information to adjust how much of a tick running subsystems can take, which reduces lag spikes perceived by players.

#### Sockets
Implements a TCP socket API similar to python's `socket`. Users may create new `/datum/socket`s, `connect()` them to a specified address and port, then `send()` and `recv()` strings. `recv()` sleeps without locking up the server until it receives any data.

#### `Topic()` filter
Replaces BYOND's malfunctioning `world/Topic()` spam limiter. You may create a white- and blacklist for always allowed and always denied IPs. Rogue clients who send data too quickly, except if they are on the whitelist, are automatically blacklisted until server restart.

## What will I be able to do with this?
These modules are planned to be included in the future.

- ~~Disasm: Disassembles procs into bytecode, mostly for use by other modules.~~
- ~~Debug server: For use with debugging; Manages breakpoints, sends and receives data from debuggers.~~
- Hotpatch server: Receives compiled bytecode (eg. from the [VSCode extension](https://github.com/SpaceManiac/SpacemanDMM)) and patches it in for live code replacement.
- ~~Maptick: Measures time taken by BYOND's SendMaps() function and makes it accessible from DM code, helping reduce lag spikes from not leaving enough processing time.~~
- Proxy objects: Forward variable reads and writes to C++.
- Websockets: Send and receive data using the websocket protocol.
- Lua: Allows writing lua scripts that replace builtin procs. Mostly for messing about.
- ~~Optimizer: Optimizes bytecode and inlines procs into each other to avoid call overhead.~~

## I want to use this!
Download the DLL and .dm file from [Releases](https://github.com/MCHSL/extools/releases). Place the DLL next to your DMB and plop the .dm somewhere where you can easily tick it. Afterwards, add `extools_initialize()` to `world/New()` or equivalent. To load modules, call `<module>_initialize()`, for example `tffi_initialize()`. Module initialization functions must be called after `extools_initialize()`!

## How do I compile this?
You need [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/), at least version 3.15.  
### Windows
You need Visual Studio, preferably 2019. Be sure to include the "C++ CMake tools for Windows".  
Create a folder next to "byond-extools" called "build". Use this as the CMake "where to build your binaries" directory.  
You can use the CMake GUI. Ensure that you select **Win32**!

If you choose to use CMake from the command line:
```
D:\Code\C++\extools\byond-extools\build> cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A Win32 ..

## Linux
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
sudo bash -c "$(wget -O - https://apt.llvm.org/llvm.sh)"
sudo apt-get install g++-10-multilib llvm-10-dev
mkdir build
cd build
export CC=clang
export CXX=clang++
cmake ../byond-extools -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
cmake --build .
```
32-bit is automatically forced when compiling on Linux.
